This repo contains all of the files from my learning web scraping and regular expressions with Python.
It will contain files from beginning to advanced as I continue to expand my knowledge of Python.

The following files follow a sample on realpython.org and use their sites set up specifically for 
webscraping:
    webscraping1.py
    webscraping2.py
    regex1.py
